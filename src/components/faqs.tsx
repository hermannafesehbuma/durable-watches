    question: 'HOW MUCH IS SHIPPING?',

    question: 'HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO RECEIVE MY ORDER?',
    answer: `Orders paid by wire will be shipped on the day we receive confirmation of the funds cleared from our bank. The cut off time to receive incoming wires is 5pm ET (3pm PST). EX: If payment is wired on a Monday, and funds are received on Monday, they go into pending status until they are cleared the following business day. On Tuesday they will be listed as cleared status and the order will be prepared for overnight shipping with an expected delivery date of Wednesday. You will receive a tracking number via email.

Orders paid by credit card go through a fraud check that typically takes 24-48 hours to complete. Once the fraud check is complete the order will be prepared for shipping and your order will go out either that same day or the following business day based on if it met the shipping cutoff time of 2pm ET.

No orders are shipped or delivered on weekends or holidays. We cannot guarantee any particular delivery date. Items ordered together may ship separately.

`,

    question: 'WHERE DO YOU SEND MY ORDER?',
    answer: `All orders will be sent to the FedEx store nearest you. Someone from our shipping department will contact you to let you know which FedEx store the package is sent to, when you go to pickup you simply take your ID into the FedEx store and they will release the package to you. This is so that the package can be fully insured for the purchase price. Although this may seem inconvenient, this process is required by our insurance, greatly reduces any claims made, and is much more secure than sending to a residence. `,

    question: 'ARE YOUR PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE ACTUAL WATCH?',
    answer: `Yes, all photos are of the exact watch without editing done to the photo to enhance it or hide blemishes.`,
  },
  {
    question: 'WHAT ARE MY PAYMENT OPTIONS?',
    answer: `Our payment options are bank wire (bank transfer), cash, all major US credit/debit cards, and our payment plan offering is via third-party provider Affirm. For international orders, we accept wire payment only. All credit card payments go through a fraud check which can take about 24-48 hours to complete. 

For deposits (when sourcing a watch) we also accept Zelle, Crypto `,
  },
  {
    question: 'DO YOU OFFER PAYMENT PLANS?',
    answer: `We do not offer a payment plan directly. For payment plans you can choose Affirm at checkout and you will be redirected to their site for payment options. If you are not satisfied with their terms you can back out of the order at any time. If you have any questions about your Affirm payment, you will need to contact Affirm directly.


Note: Listed prices are advertised for wire transfer and already discounted 6.7% compared to the cost when using Affirm. Affirm orders will need to add 6.7% to the price you see advertised. EX: If a watch is listed at $10,000, when using affirm the total would be $10,670`,
  },
