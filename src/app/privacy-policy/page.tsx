          As described above, we use your Personal Information to provide you

          may be of interest to you. For example: We use Google Analytics to

          or other similar technologies (which you may consent to, depending on
          your location). We use Shopify Audiences to help us show ads on other
          websites with our advertising partners to buyers who made purchases
          with other Shopify merchants and who may also be interested in what we
          have to offer. We also share information about your use of the Site,
          your purchases, and the email address associated with your purchases
          with Shopify Audiences, through which other Shopify merchants may make
          offers you may be interested in. For more information about how
          targeted advertising works, you can visit the Network Advertising
